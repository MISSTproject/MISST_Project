# LaTex Source Code

Source code for pdf documents in the repository. Any diagrams included in the document should also be under the [figures_diagrams](https://github.com/MISSTproject/MISST_Project/tree/master/figures_diagrams) directory.

## Software

I used TeXstudio to compile and create the pdf docs. 

## Important Notice
If you plan on downloading a .tex file and compiling it, be aware that LaTex needs to know the relative path to the graphic. Since the relative path from .tex file and the figures stored on your local machine might differ, for successful compilation, either:
* Match the directory structure implied by the latex code.
* Modify relative path for every figure.
