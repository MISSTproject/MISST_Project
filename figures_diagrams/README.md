# Diagrams and Figures

All figures and diagrams used in repository documentation is included here.

## Naming Convention

The f#_ and c#_ prefixes are simply used for ease of reference. A higher number generally means that the figure or capture is newer. A 'f' prefix is short for figure, an original graphic. A 'c' prefix is short for capture, a screenshot.

Files Control_Unit_design.png and overall_system_v2.png do not follow the naming convention because they are regularly changed as the system design is updated. They are updated by exporting the associated visio file to a png format. These visio files are in the [visio_files](https://github.com/MISSTproject/MISST_Project/tree/master/figures_diagrams/visio_files) directory.
