# Visio Files Directory

These two Visio files (.vsdx) contain the diagram for the control unit design and the overall system design of MISST core. As the design is improved and updated, update the Visio files and create updated diagrams. The .vssx file is a visio library of useful objects used in both .vsdx files. See the user guide for tips on using visio.
